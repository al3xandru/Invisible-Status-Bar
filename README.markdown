Invisible Status Bar
================

Overview
--------

Invisible Status Bar is an extension for Apple Safari 5. Save display space or appeal to your own sense of minimalism by hiding Safari's native status bar, and using the Invisible Status Bar instead. Only shows up when you hover over a link, i.e. when you need a status bar.

Installation
------------
1. Click to install the extension, or download it and drag into a Safari window:
	
	- [Invisible Status Bar for Safari](http://dbergey.github.com/Invisible-Status-Bar/invisiblestatusbar.safariextz)
	
2. Click all ensuing confirmation buttons.

Both browsers provide an automatic extension update service, so there should be continual improvements where needed. Safari will not install updates without permission unless you check "Install Updates Automatically" in Extensions preferences; Chrome updates them automatically.

Sites With Remaining Quirks

- Covers next button in google reader

Future Plans
------------

- theme: light
- useful hotkeys like  ⌘C to copy the selected link, and ⌘I to send the link to instapaper
